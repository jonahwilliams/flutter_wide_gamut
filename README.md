# flutter_wide_gamut

A project that demonstrates wide gamut colors. Requires an iOS device and Impeller. Sorry no simulators!

Yes this is a picture I took with a different phone because the iOS screenshot tool doesn't work with wide gamut colors. No, the colors may not
actually be wide gamut in the picture, you'll have to run it locally to see for real.
